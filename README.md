# Alexis-Bio-Readme
Hi, my name is Alexis Aniglo. I am a Saint Peter's University Freshman. I became interested in computer science during my junior year of highschool after completing AP Computer Science Principles as a class.
I hope to achieve a strong, well developed portfolio full of a variety of special projects aimed towards my computer science endeavors through using GitHub.
